# timetracker
With TimeTracker, you can track the time you spend on different activities. The tool is designed for people learning new skills that requires a lot of time. Having a time tracker application can add some motivation towards spending the necessary time on something, for example if you are studying a new language. The app allows you to track several different activities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
You need the Python interpreter installed on your computer. If you are using Python2, just import tkinter with a capital T.

### Installing
**1.** Change directory to the directory you want the files to be stored inside, and clone the git repository with this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/JaranMellerud/timetracker.git
```
**2.** Change directory to the project directory and install the required packages (preferably in a virtual environment you have created):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**3.** Run the application like this:
```
python timetracker.py
```
**4.** Now the GUI opens. Here you can add or delete new activities and start/pause the timer. When you open the application again after you have closed it, all your activities and the time spent will be saved.
